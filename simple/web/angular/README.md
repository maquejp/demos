## Angular Best Practices Demonstrated

### Component Architecture

- Standalone components (Angular 17+)
- Input and output properties
- Lifecycle hooks
- Change detection strategies

### TypeScript Integration

- Strong typing throughout
- Interface definitions
- Generic usage
- Type guards and validation

### Reactive Programming

- RxJS operators and observables
- Reactive forms
- Async data handling
- Error handling strategies

### Styling and Design

- Angular Material components
- CSS encapsulation
- Responsive design principles
- Theme customization

## Development Patterns

### File Organization

- Feature-based module structure
- Shared components and utilities
- Consistent naming conventions
- Barrel exports for clean imports

### State Management

- Component-level state
- Service-based shared state
- RxJS for async operations
- Immutable data patterns

### Routing and Navigation

- Angular Router configuration
- Route guards and resolvers
- Lazy loading strategies
- Navigation patterns

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization

- Tree shaking and dead code elimination
- AOT compilation
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Lazy loading implementation

### Runtime Performance

- OnPush change detection
- TrackBy functions in ngFor
- Pure pipes and memoization
- Efficient DOM manipulation

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

- Jasmine and Karma setup
- Component testing patterns
- Service testing with mocks
- Pipe and directive testing

### Integration Testing

- End-to-end testing with Cypress
- Component integration tests
- Service integration testing
- User interaction testing

## Accessibility

- ARIA attributes and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast and color blind friendly design
- Focus management

## Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
ng build --configuration production

# Deploy to static hosting
# (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
```

### Environment Configuration

- Environment-specific builds
- API endpoint configuration
- Feature flag management
- Build optimization per environment
