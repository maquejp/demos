cd simple/web/react/resume

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
```

## React Best Practices Demonstrated

### Component Architecture

- Functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Component composition patterns
- Props drilling vs context usage
- Render props and children patterns

### State Management

- useState for local state
- useEffect for side effects
- useContext for global state
- useReducer for complex state logic
- External state management patterns

### Modern React Patterns

- Custom hooks for business logic
- Compound component patterns
- Higher-order components
- Render optimization techniques
- Error boundaries implementation

## Development Patterns

### File Organization

- Feature-based component structure
- Shared components and utilities
- Custom hooks separation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Barrel exports for clean imports

### Performance Optimization

- React.memo for component memoization
- useCallback and useMemo hooks
- Code splitting with lazy loading
- Virtualization for large lists
- Bundle optimization techniques

### Styling Strategies

- Tailwind CSS utility-first approach
- CSS-in-JS alternatives
- Styled components patterns
- CSS Modules usage
- Responsive design implementation

## Build Tools and Development

- Fast development server
- Hot module replacement
- TypeScript integration
- Plugin ecosystem
- Production optimization

### Development Workflow

- ESLint and Prettier integration
- TypeScript strict mode
- Component testing with Testing Library
- Bundle analysis tools
- Pre-commit hooks

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

- React Testing Library setup
- Component testing patterns
- Hook testing with renderHook
- Mock implementation strategies
- Snapshot testing considerations

### Integration Testing

- User interaction testing
- Form validation testing
- Route navigation testing
- API integration testing
- End-to-end testing setup

## TypeScript Integration

### Type Safety

- Interface definitions for props
- Generic component patterns
- Type-safe event handlers
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Type guards and validation

### Development Experience

- IntelliSense and autocomplete
- Compile-time error checking
- Refactoring safety
- Documentation generation
- Type-driven development

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML usage
- ARIA attributes and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management patterns
- High contrast and color considerations

## Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Deploy to static hosting
# (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
```
