# Project coding standards

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## Commit Messages
- Use conventional commit messages
- Use the format: `type(scope): subject`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- Scope: optional, use for clarity
- Subject: short description of the change
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "update")
- Use the present tense (e.g., "change", not "changed" or "changes")
- Use the body to explain the "why" and "how" of the change
